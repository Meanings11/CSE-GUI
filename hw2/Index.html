    <!-- Browse the components and utilities sections under documentation at http://getbootstrap.com/. There, you will find the modal, tabs, navigation bar, side panel and other features shown in the video. See my pointers in red in the attached screenshots. Please note that my CSS file only contained 5-6 style definitions. The rest were made possible with Bootstrap alone. -->
